        <p>I recently updated XCode on my MacOS Mojave hackintosh, and to my surprise thereafter, was unable to install a version of the MySQL2 gem for a project I was working on. The solution ultimately was to install a package I didn&rsquo;t know existed.</p>
<p>When upgrading to a slightly newer version of Ruby for a (somewhat legacy) project I was working on, I had to re-bundle to reinstall gems. One of those was <code>mysql2</code>. But I had just updated XCode and unbeknownst to me, that update had (re)moved multiple header files needed to compile all sorts of things, including this gem.</p>
<p>So when I tried <code>bundle</code>, eventually I got this:</p>
<pre><code>Fetching mysql2 0.3.21

Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

To see why this extension failed to compile, please check the mkmf.log which can be found here:

Gem files will remain installed in /Users/jah/.rbenv/versions/2.3.8/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/mysql2-0.3.21 for inspection.

An error occurred while installing mysql2 (0.3.21), and Bundler cannot continue.

</code></pre><p>Well, that&rsquo;s rather cryptic, isnt' it? So why did it fail to compile?</p>
<p>When looking at <code>mkmf.log</code> as suggested, I found out why:</p>
<pre><code>ld: library not found for -lssl

</code></pre><p>Well, that&rsquo;s not great, is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how do you fix that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run this in terminal:</p>
<p><code>open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages</code></p>
<p>Double click <code>macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg</code> and install, then re-try installing your gem or recompiling whatever was failing before.</p>
<p>Might work for multiple missing libraries that <code>ld</code> complains about not finding.</p>
