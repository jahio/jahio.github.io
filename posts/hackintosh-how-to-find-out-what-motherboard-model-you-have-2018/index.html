        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh">Hackintosh</a> enthusiasts often have to fix small but important missing or malfunctioning features of their OS after they get their first successful build, and key to that is <em>knowing your hardware.</em> And instead of being outright lied to by MacOS and its built-in tools, I&rsquo;ll show you how one terminal command can help you <strong>get the truth.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get straight to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ ioreg -rc FakeSMCKeyStore
+-o FakeSMCKeyStore  &lt;class FakeSMCKeyStore, id 0x100000128, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 13&gt;
    {

      &quot;IOMatchCategory&quot; = &quot;FakeSMCKeyStore&quot;
      &quot;IOClass&quot; = &quot;FakeSMCKeyStore&quot;
      &quot;IOProviderClass&quot; = &quot;IOResources&quot;
      &quot;manufacturer&quot; = &quot;ASUS&quot;
      &quot;product-name&quot; = &quot;Z97-AR&quot;
      &quot;IOUserClientClass&quot; = &quot;FakeSMCKeyStoreUserClient&quot;
      &quot;IOResourceMatch&quot; = &quot;IOKit&quot;
    }

$

</code></pre><p>Jackpot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without making this a huge <em>thing</em> on the SMC and UEFI and spoofing it and all that, in a nutshell we&rsquo;re using an open-source kernel extension to give us REAL information about our hardware. Since we loaded <a href="https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-fakesmc-kozlek">FakeSMC</a> at boot as a kernel extension, that same kernel module is now loaded and running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not just open up the case and look around?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, because <em>I got pissed off.</em>  <a href="http://nasa.gov/">NASA</a> put a dude <em>on the MOON before I was born</em>. How the hell is it we can&rsquo;t, 49 years later on one of the best operating systems in existence, not get some basic information with that software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was wrong with <code>sysctl</code> and <code>system_profiler</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, <code>sysctl</code> can&rsquo;t really tell you much about your computer other than your processor:</p>
<pre><code>$ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz
$

</code></pre><p>Which, yeah that&rsquo;s&hellip;kind of useful. Maybe. But as far as I can tell, it won&rsquo;t give you anything else that&rsquo;s clear and useful in making an inventory of what&rsquo;s <em>actually</em> in your damn computer.</p>
<p>Which brings me to one baby seal I&rsquo;d like to club: <code>system_profiler</code></p>

<p>This is basically a command-line version of the native, Apple-created desktop app similarly named (<code>/Applications/Utilities/System Information.app</code>). While you can get <em>some</em> useful hardware information out of that app, the crucial data you need to profile your system comes from the SMBIOS settings you&rsquo;ve configured (likely through something like <a href="https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/">Clover Configurator</a>), which you&rsquo;d only do <em>to get compatibility with essentially the same hardware</em>.</p>
<p>Common sense 101: Don&rsquo;t tell me what I already know; I&rsquo;m the one who told it to you!</p>
<p>This is why <code>ioreg</code>, talking to the aforementioned kernel extension, is so useful.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Linux, we have <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code>. On BSD you can access <code>/kern</code>. On Windows there are a plethora of open source, free, GPL-licensed tools (that are even still maintained!) to do the same thing. Why the hell should MacOS be any different?</p>
<p>Apple, I&rsquo;m not happy with you. <strong>Shit like this is WHY people are Hackintoshing.</strong></p>
