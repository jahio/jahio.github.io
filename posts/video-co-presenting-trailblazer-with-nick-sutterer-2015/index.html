<p>Nick is a great guy, and a lot of fun to work with. For some reason he and I get along famously well, and Engine Yard asked us to co-present that year. In this presentation, Nick explains the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of Trailblazer, and I show the audience an application built with Nick&rsquo;s framework.</p>
<p>I encourage you to watch the full presentation as it&rsquo;s interesting and Nick is a great presenter, but my demo starts at about 24:30 in.</p>
