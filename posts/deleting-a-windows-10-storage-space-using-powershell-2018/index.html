        <p>If you tried to delete a Storage Space via the built-in Windows GUI and it just hangs forever, try this PowerShell method for quickly deleting it so you can re-use your drives.</p>
<p>I recently set up a Windows 10 Storage Space - basically a built-in software RAID - and realized the performance was <em>horrible</em>, so I went to delete it. But the GUI just sat there and hung for hours, with no progress and no errors reported. After a shut-down, removal of the drives in question, removing the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; devices from Device Manager (View -&gt; Show hidden devices), and a couple reboots, I finally found out how to remove the storage space itself from Windows, so that I could then re-use my drives in another way.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>After launching an admin PowerShell session, we&rsquo;ll use some built-in tools to retrieve the name and status of the &ldquo;StoragePool&rdquo; object in question. Then using more of Windows built-in tools, we&rsquo;ll nuke it.</p>
<h3 id="launch-a-powershell-admin-session">Launch a PowerShell Admin Session<a href="#launch-a-powershell-admin-session" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p><code>WIN+X</code> and navigate to &ldquo;Windows PowerShell (Admin)&rdquo; and pop that open.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-name-and-status-of-the-storage-pool">Get the name and status of the storage pool<a href="#get-the-name-and-status-of-the-storage-pool" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>In this case, my storage pool was just named, aptly, &ldquo;Storage Pool&rdquo;.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; Get-StoragePool

FriendlyName OperationalStatus HealthStatus IsPrimordial IsReadOnly    Size AllocatedSize
------------ ----------------- ------------ ------------ ----------    ---- -------------
Storage pool Read-only         Unhealthy    False        False      2.73 TB        6.5 GB
Primordial   OK                Healthy      True         False      4.28 TB      931.5 GB

</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;Primordial?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea, and I&rsquo;m not at all a Windows admin. If somebody knows, holler at me and I&rsquo;ll update this post.</p>
<h3 id="set-read-only-to-false">Set Read-Only to FALSE<a href="#set-read-only-to-false" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The first major problem I ran into with this method was that trying to delete the storage pool always failed, saying that it&rsquo;s status was set to &ldquo;read only&rdquo;. After some searching, I found that you can use PowerShell to fix that, too:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; Get-StoragePool -FriendlyName &quot;Storage pool&quot; | Set-StoragePool -IsReadOnly $false

</code></pre><p>Now you should be able to modify the storage pool.</p>
<h3 id="nuke-it">Nuke it<a href="#nuke-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s no longer read-only, you can delete the storage pool with this command:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; Get-StoragePool -FriendlyName &quot;Storage pool&quot; | Remove-StoragePool

Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
This will remove the StoragePool &quot;Storage pool&quot;.
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is &quot;Y&quot;): y
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;

</code></pre><p>As you can see here, it&rsquo;ll prompt you for confirmation interactively. <em>Real</em> Windows admins can probably tell me/you/us how to script that for non-interaction, but since my use case is &ldquo;power user&rdquo; I&rsquo;m fine with confirming interactively.</p>
<p>Once you run this, in my case PowerShell displayed an interesting progress indicator at the top of the window itself for a few seconds, then it was done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long will this take?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know. When I used the Control Panel GUI to try to remove this storage space, it hung <em>forever and a day</em>, doing nothing but giving me a pretty green progress bar. After letting this run for quite a while, I tried to cancel it, but it just sat there doing the same thing. <em>I had to forcefully cut power to the computer entirely to move on.</em> After yanking the drives (USB 3), rebooting, yanking the USB <em>hub</em> too, and rebooting again, I was finally able to use the above commands to delete the storage space itself, thus freeing the drives from the OS perspective to be re-used. When I finally ran this, the deletion operation itself only took about 3 seconds. Bear in mind, however, I&rsquo;d already removed the USB 3 drives from Device Manager (remember: View -&gt; Show hidden devices) under &ldquo;Disk Drives&rdquo;, and all &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; and non-used volumes under &ldquo;Volumes&rdquo;. I suspect that&rsquo;s why this ran so fast in PowerShell, but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet you a Coke that doing it this way is almost always going to work faster and better!</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re not using StorageSpaces, what <em>are</em> you planning to use?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m leaning toward <a href="https://stablebit.com/DrivePool">StableBit DrivePool</a>. It&rsquo;s not quite software-RAID, in that it doesn&rsquo;t work like a RAID setup at all. Instead, it allows you to combine <code>N</code> number of disks of any kind &ldquo;in userspace&rdquo; basically and then creates a virtually-exposed &ldquo;disk&rdquo; for the operating system that is a proxy/abstraction layer on top of the disks you tell DrivePool to use. Then, when you write to the &ldquo;pooled&rdquo; (virtual) disk, DrivePool handles the work of duplicating files across the <em>physical</em> disks in the pool according to whatever settings you give it. Perhaps the biggest &ldquo;win&rdquo; here for this product, in my opinion, is that it does this on top of the existing filesystem on each disk, such that if you lose a disk or need to restore, you just access the files directly from the disk as if it&rsquo;s mounted NTFS or exFAT or whatever. <strong>You don&rsquo;t need to re-install DrivePool to recover your files &ndash; you just need to mount the disks normally.</strong></p>
<p>The one downside of DrivePool in my experience (which I admit is nascent, at best) is that it tends to be pretty I/O heavy. It&rsquo;ll do a lot of work to duplicate files across your pool according to your policies that you set, and to reorganize data for better storage and performance, but this means it&rsquo;s very often engaged in disk I/O, so if you have slower disks (e.g. 5400RPM old school hard drives) over, say, USB2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA">You&rsquo;re Gonna Have a Bad Time</a>.</p>
