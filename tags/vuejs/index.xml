      <description>I recently wrote an article for Josh Software, a software consultancy that I began working for in April of this year. It&amp;rsquo;s about the differences between React.js and Vue.js (version 2) and explores those differences from a variety of perspectives for the benefit of front-end developers.
Coming into the research phase of this article, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seriously done anything with front-end since the days of Netscape Navigator! I&amp;rsquo;ve of course kept up with changes over the years, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really worked in front end exclusively or heavily since the mid to late 2000&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>I happen to like Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari browser, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to use it when developing stuff with Vue.js. I ran into a problem with this, however: Safari would cache the response from the live-reload development server on localhost, so that when I made changes it didn&amp;rsquo;t update, even when hitting the reload button. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve solved this though with a Cache-Control header configued in the project&amp;rsquo;s vue.config.js file.
tl;dr Put this in a file at project root called vue.</description>
