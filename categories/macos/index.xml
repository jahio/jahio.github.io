      <description>I recently updated XCode on my MacOS Mojave hackintosh, and to my surprise thereafter, was unable to install a version of the MySQL2 gem for a project I was working on. The solution ultimately was to install a package I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed.
When upgrading to a slightly newer version of Ruby for a (somewhat legacy) project I was working on, I had to re-bundle to reinstall gems. One of those was mysql2.</description>

      <description>When creating OS installation media, a lot of people suggest using various third party tools, such as Etcher and others. However, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy just using dd (Data Dump) on any Unix-like OS to do the same thing.
Zero Out the Disk Insert a USB stick and identify its appropriate name under /dev/. For MacOS, you can try diskutil list - just identify the disk that wasn&amp;rsquo;t there before you inserted your USB stick.</description>
